This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
```
```{r}
data <- read_xls("H:/Quantos/quantos/Dosing 2018/01052018.xls")
str(data)

```

```{r}
dir_path <- "H:/Quantos/quantos/Dosing 2018"
re_file <- ".xls"

read_sheets <- function(dir_path, file){
  xls_file <- paste0(dir_path, file)
  xls_file %>%
    excel_sheets() %>%
    set_names() %>%
    map_dfr(read_excel, path = xls_file, .id = 'sheet_name') %>% 
    mutate(file_name = file) %>% 
    select(file_name, sheet_name, everything())
}

df <- list.files(dir_path, re_file)
df
read_sheets

```

```{r}


```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
