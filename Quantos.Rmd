This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(purrr)

# Quantos data directory path
# Starting with 2018 directory, but we'll expand it to get files
# from all the yearly directories
dir_path <- "H:/Quantos/quantos/Dosing 2018"
```

```{r}
files <- dir(path=dir_path, full.names=TRUE, pattern = "*.xls")
```


```{r}
data<- files %>%
  map(function(x) read_xls(x, col_names=FALSE)) %>%
  reduce(rbind)
data
```

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x=X__3))+geom_histogram()
```



# Load quantos data

```{r}
# Initial working excel read
data <- read_xls("H:/Quantos/quantos/Dosing 2018/01052018.xls", col_names=FALSE)

#Add some abstraction so we can load a file that's in a variable
file <- "H:/Quantos/quantos/Dosing 2018/01052018.xls"
data <- read_xls(file, col_names=FALSE)
str(data)

```
Next thing is to modify the read_xls() to tell it there's no header line
Googling with "read_xls r header" showed me that the option you need to
Set is `col_names`.

After that, you can make a list of files to read and read them into a single
dataframe by running a `for` loop (easier) or using something like `apply` or `map_dfr` (more advanced).

```{r}
re_file <- ".xls"

read_sheets <- function(dir_path, file){
  xls_file <- paste0(dir_path, file)
  xls_file %>%
    excel_sheets() %>%
    set_names() %>%
    map_dfr(read_excel, path = xls_file, .id = 'sheet_name') %>% 
    mutate(file_name = file) %>% 
    select(file_name, sheet_name, everything())
}

df <- list.files(dir_path, re_file)
df
read_sheets

```

```{r}


```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
